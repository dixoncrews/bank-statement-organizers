# Bank Statement Organizers

About twice a year, I download bills/bank statements as PDFs and organize them into folders for posterity. The process of renaming these files is tedious, so I've started writing scripts to do it for me.

Your use of these scripts is **at your own risk**.

## Usage Instructions

This script does not support multiple accounts/folders.
1. Download statements and place them all in a folder.
2. Open the `bluevine.py` file from within the statement folder.
3. Run the file to rename all of the statements.

### Chase
This script supports multiple accounts/folders.
1. Download statements and place them all in a folder.
